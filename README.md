# Test Driven React Assessment

A set of tasks to assesses the skills of a candidate for a React position, or to evaluate and improve one's own skills.
Fundamental concept demonstrations for learning/assessment of React.
Simple exercises that clearly isolate each concept.

1. Clear documentation blocks with examples and expected outputs
2. Graduated difficulty from basic concepts to advanced patterns
